			<h1>Welcome to my rambling.</h1>
			<p>For one of my journalism classes, my instructor encouraged his students to keep journals of their creative process through the semester.</p>
			<p>Here's a look at some of the work I did for class, some of what I did outside of class, and I thought through each.</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<h1>Alphabet project</h1>
			<img style="box-shadow: 3px 3px 5px #888888;" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2904/13990819733_28755cc70c.jpg">
			<p>For this assignment, I had to look for the alphabet in unlikely places.</p>
			<p>Sounds easy enough, right?</p>
			<p>Well, I had to complicate it. I began looking for the alphabet where nothing existed at all.</p>
			<p>I tried to find it in shadows and negative spaces. I wanted to illustrate exactly how much we don't see. By making something that isn't tangible into something meaningful, I hoped to validate the idea that nothing is, in and of itself, something.</p>
			<p>That was really, really tricky.</p>
			<p>Some were fails. Some were awesome. I really liked the "n" and "g".</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<h1>A new one for me</h1>
			<img style="box-shadow: 3px 3px 5px #888888;" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7316/13970834815_3b74fd153b.jpg">
			<p>This semester, I had to create a WPAP image of myself.</p>
			<p>WPAP stands for Wedha's Pop Art Portrait. It uses geometry and repetition, typically along with a popping color pallet, to illustrate a person's face.</p>
			<p>It was a really fun piece to produce. It's not often that I get to illustrate, and I appreciated the opportunity.</p>
			<p>I wish I would have taken more chances with it, though.</p>
			<p>If I were to do it again, I would develop a shape pallet, for lack of a better word. I would choose a shape and repeat it throughout.</p>
			<p>I would also diversify my color pallet. I chose these colors because I most identify with them, as is evident on my website and even my resume. But ultimately, it was very limiting.</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<h1>Typography poster</h1>
			<img style="box-shadow: 3px 3px 5px #888888;" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7412/13967655352_f804830a0d.jpg">
			<p>I hate this piece.</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<h1>Designing an advertisement</h1>
			<img style="box-shadow: 3px 3px 5px #888888;" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7309/13991119773_86ba511d1c.jpg">
			<p>For this assignment, I had to direct a photo shoot for a White House Black Market advertisement.</p>
			<p>It wasn't my first shoot, so I decided to have a little fun.</p>
			<p>I put on some crazy music and danced with my model and photographer for a while.</p>
			<p>My model had been tense, and having some fun helped her relax enough to stop feeling so self-conscious.</p>
			<p>I love the final outcome. But I wish I would have chosen different type and made the clothes more the emphasis than the mood.</p>
			<p>I think this would be a better JCPenny ad than WHBM.</p>

			<h1>Playing with ad styles</h1>
				</br></br><div style="background-image:url('http://wallpoper.com/images/00/39/57/93/bottles-alcohol_00395793.jpg');background-attachment:fixed;background-position:center;background-repeat:repeat;background-width:100%;height:350px;width:90%;text-align:center;text-shadow: 1px 1px 5px #000000;color:#ffffff;"><div style="top:5px;float:right;text-size:10pt;padding-right:5px;">Advertisement</div><br><div style="top:25%;position:relative;"><span style="font-size:50pt;">Liquor store</span><br><br><span style="font-size:20pt;">Details about liquor go here<br>with more information here.<br>You can include <a href="http://hoosierride.com/">links</a>.</span></div></div></br></br>
			<p>I made this piece after seeing some really incredible work from <a href="www.voxmedia.com">Vox Media</a>. They have remarkable and unconventional ad spots that I think are far more enticing than standard positions.</p>
			<p>I wanted to get BallStateDaily.com up to par.</p>
			<p>The ad at once commands attention and falls away. It upstages the content without being flashy. Instead of using awkward and forced animation to grab attention, it latches onto a natural user instinct: the scroll.</p>
			<p>It almost gives the user control over the ad.</p>
			<p>I also see amazing editorial potential for something like this.</p>
			<p>Though I don't know exactly what story might lend itself to this sort of tool, I am actively seeking the opportunity to implement it.</p>
			</br></br><div style="background-image:url('http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/24922518.jpg');background-attachment:fixed;background-position:center;background-repeat:repeat;background-width:1000px;height:600px;width:720px;text-align:center;text-shadow: 1px 1px 5px #000000;color:#ffffff;"><div style="top:0;position:relative;"><img src="http://i486.photobucket.com/albums/rr224/callieb89/window/window-frame-2-1024.gif" width="720" height="600"></div></div></br></br>

			<h1>Knights of the Dinner Table</h1>
			<iframe style="border:2px solid #67B6CA; box-shadow: 3px 3px 5px #888888;" src="http://feature.ballstatedaily.com/knightsofthedinnertable.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
			<p>This was a super fun project for <a href="www.ballstatedaily.com">BallStateDaily.com</a></p>
			<p>Features reporter Danielle Grady wrote this piece about an alumnus who creates "Dungeons and Dragons"-themed comics based on his time at Ball State.</p>
			<p>When I read it, I immediately wanted to see the artist's work. But I didn't know how to make random comics break up the story's cohesion.</p>
			<p>So, I picked out a few scenes from the story and asked the artist if he would mind helping out. He said yes.</p>
			<p>So, we ended up with this awesome piece.</p>
			<p>I did all the coding myself, including the responsiveness.</p>
			<p>See the story on alive <a href="http://feature.ballstatedaily.com/knightsofthedinnertable.html">here</a>.</p>
