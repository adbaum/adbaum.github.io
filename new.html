    	<h1>Work it.</h1>
    	<p><b>By Adam Baumgartner</b></p><br>
			<p>For an assignment this semester, an instructor had me direct a photo shoot for the clothing company White House Black Market.</p>
			<p>The idea behind the assignment was that I learn a company's style well enough to mimic it while telling a photographer and model what I need from them.</p>
			<p>By the time I completed it, I gained more experience working with photographers on lighting and angels, but also in helping models understand my vision.</p>
			<p>Before I began the shoot, though, I studied up on the company's history and past ad campaigns.</p>
			<p>The ads all had common themes: simplicity, elegance, basic colors.</p>
			<p>I loved them. But I wanted to do something a little different.</p>
			<p>The ad I was creating was supposed to be specifically for spring fashion.</p>
			<p>The winter that had just ended was the absolute worst. I believed firmly everyone needed more color in their lives, even if wearing black and white.</p>
			<p>So, I played around transposing WHBM models into different colorful scenes.</p>
			<p>When I finally found a concept I liked, I had the vision I needed for this shoot.</p>
			<p>I dressed my model in simple clothes that fit the WHBM look, but then I did something different.</p>
			<p>I put on fun music and started dancing.</p>
			<p>The model had been nervous before, but after she saw me dancing like a idiot, she joined in. By the time we began shooting, she was feeling confident and energetic.</p>
			<p>I think that showed on camera.</p>
			<center><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7316/14070940342_5422dce146_o.jpg"><br>
			<img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7380/14074566204_33fe98bd16_o.jpg"></center>
			<p>I may have succumbed to the fun, too.</p>
			<center><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7335/13887499269_d88948752a_o.jpg"></center>
			<p>After I got several shots I though I could work with, I wrapped up the shoot and began photo editing.</p>
			<p>I'm not sure how well I did. I'm not very familiar with Photoshop, so my technique was probably inefficent. Lots of cut outs and pastes in place.</p>
			<p>Not to mention, I was working with a tricky image.</p>
			<center><img style="background-color:#ffffff;" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5253/13884712790_a60fe98b79_o.png"></center>
			<p>All in all, I think it turned out well. Much to my own surprise.</p>
			<center><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7190/13884684809_fc51020f4c_o.jpg"></center>
			<p>Then, all I had to do was add the typography and I was good to go.</p>
			<p>I knew I wanted the piece to be bright and bold, straying slightly from the WHBM look to offer a relief from the winter.</p>
			<p>For that reason, I went with a cursive font to add to the curls and swirls of the paint.</p>
			<center><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7309/13991119773_e013160052_o.png"></center>
			<p>I was definitely happy with the end product. I think it shows a woman who is happy and in control of her surroundings. The paint rises up around her, almost as though she's parting the Red Sea.</p>
			<p>At the same time, I worry that it strays too far from the WHBM image.</p>
			<p>Actually, I think this might be better suited for JC Penny.</p>
			<p>If I were to do this again, I would make the type more elegant, sticking with a serif. I would also have gone with a shot in which the model wasn't looking at the camera, and I would have had her look less fun and more fierce.</p>
			<p>The paint splotches at the top come across as childish to me now, too. I was trying to unify the top and bottom.</p>
			<p>But, you live and you learn. Overall, I'm pleased with this product and the experience as a whole.</p>

    	<h1>Finding the nothing, making it something.</h1>

			<p>Find the alphabet in unlikely places. That was the assignment my instructor gave me.</p>
			<p>Sounds easy enough, right?</p>
			<p>Well, I had to complicate it. I began looking for the alphabet where nothing existed at all.</p>
			<p>I tried to find it in shadows and negative spaces. I wanted to illustrate exactly how much we don't see. By making something that isn't tangible into something meaningful, I hoped to validate the idea that nothing is, in and of itself, something.</p>
			<p><i>(Oh, we're getting deep now!)</i></p>
			<p>That was really, really tricky.</p>
			<p>Some were fails. Some were awesome. I really liked the "n" and "g".</p>

    	<h1>A new illustrating experience.</h1>

	<p>This semester, I had to create a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wpap&es_sm=119&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=NqZWU5rDGdPEsATz84GoBQ&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1179&bih=605">WPAP</a> image of myself.</p>
	<p>WPAP stands for Wedha Pop Art Portrait. It uses geometry and repetition, typically along with a popping color pallet, to illustrate a person's face.</p>
	<p>It was a really fun piece to produce. It's not often that I get to illustrate, and I appreciated the opportunity.</p>
	<p>I wish I would have taken more chances with it, though.</p>
	<p>If I were to do it again, I would develop a shape pallet, for lack of a better word. I would choose a shape and repeat it throughout.</p>
	<p>I would also diversify my color pallet. I chose these colors because I most identify with them, as is evident on my website and even my resume. But ultimately, it was very limiting.</p>

			<p>I hate this piece.</p>
			<p>The short of the long is that my instructor wanted me to produce a typography poster given specific quotes.</p>
			<p>I made a much more simple piece, initially.</p>
			<p>He said he didn't feel it conveyed the emotion I was attempting, so I dramatized it.</p>
			<p>I settled for an end product I didn't like instead of finding a place between simple and exagerated.</p>

    	<h1>Thinking of design as tags and variables.</h1>

    	<p>This semester, I worked independently on a lot of coding projects. I coded my portfolio first, then I worked on a kind of template for Ball State Daily News article pages.</p>
    	<p>From there, I was able to branch out and create the three pieces above.</p>
    	<p>It's been a blast. I absolutely love learning new things.</p>
    	<p>But it's also been a serious challenge. Code is tricky. It's very finnicky. And if you don't know what you're doing, it's entirely uncooperative.</p>
    	<p>Guess and check is not a good method of coding.</p>
    	<p>In order to start off in web design, I had to throw away what I knew about the tidy and easy to use infrastructure of the Adobe Suite.</p>
    	<p>I also had to abandon attention to detail, at first. Otherwise, I would have gone insane.</p>
    	<p>It's important with each web project to keep in mind what you want to accomplish and learn accordingly.</p>
    	<p>You can't start out trying to know it all.</p>
    	<p>So, first I taught myself HTML and CSS.</p>
    	<p>Then I taught myself how to make HTML and CSS cleaner.</p>
    	<p>Then, I began applying JQuery.</p>
    	<p>In the near future, I plan to learn JavaScript and PHP, but always one at a time.</p>
    	<p>It's important when designing for the Internet to remember you're working with a bunch of variables that represent objects.</p>
    	<p>There's no clicking or dragging elements around. Maybe copying and pasting, if you're lucky.</p>
    	<p>But it takes so much creativity and problem solving to make the end product perfect, it's well worth it.</p>

			<p>I made this piece after seeing some really incredible work from <a href="http://www.voxmedia.com">Vox Media</a>. They have remarkable and unconventional ad spots that I think are far more enticing than standard positions.</p>
			<p>I wanted to get <a href="http://www.ballstatedaily.com">BallStateDaily.com</a> up to par.</p>
			<p>The ad at once commands attention and falls away. It upstages the content without being flashy. Instead of using awkward and forced animation to grab attention, it latches onto a natural user instinct: the scroll.</p>
			<p>It almost gives the user control over the ad.</p>
			<p>I also see amazing editorial potential for something like this.</p>
			<p>Though I don't know exactly what story might lend itself to this sort of tool, I am actively seeking the opportunity to implement it.</p>

    	<h1>Problem solving at #SNDmakes.</h1>
    	<p><b>By Adam Baumgartner</b></p><br>
    	<p>We all just want to make the Internet a better place, right?</p>
<p>So that's what a group of coders, designers and thinkers set out to do March 19-22.</p>
<p>At the first&nbsp;<a href="http://www.snd.org/2014/03/agenda-for-sndmakes-designathon-indy-storyform/" target="_blank">#SNDmakes</a>, four teams set out to find solutions to problems users encounter when viewing content with current article forms.</p>
<p>And it. Was. Awesome.</p>
<p>As a student, I was able to sit in a room with a bunch of thoughtful professionals and observe the ways they approach different challenges.</p>
<p>I watched as representatives of traditional newsrooms and newer media brought their ideas to the table, finding answers that could work in either setting. And of course, I was able to bring my own ideas forth, too.</p>
<p>As a group, we asked ourselves, "How might we ... ?" until we had covered a wall with oversized Post Its with possible ideas.</p>
<p>We then selected four questions and split up into four teams to solve them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.snd.org/2014/03/team-blue-creates-skim-at-sndmakes/" target="_blank">How might we create a mobile experience that makes long form content easily scannable?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.snd.org/2014/03/team-pink-creates-sluice-js-at-sndmakes/" target="_blank">How might we better surface social sharing within a story to give newsrooms powerful social insights and readers more connection to the story and their Twitter community?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.snd.org/2014/03/a-tool-for-providing-backstory-to-readers-at-sndmakes/" target="_blank">How might we encourage discovery from different entry points in a story timeline</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.snd.org/2014/03/a-tool-for-browsing-moving-stories-at-sndmakes/" target="_blank">How might we design video experiences that allow for variable time commitments?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My team worked on the last bullet.</p>
<p>With representatives from the San Francisco Chronicle, CNN, NPR, Knight Lab and two student publications, we believed we could all benefit from creating a better video experience.</p>
<p>What we came up with was a format that allows videos to determine their own pace when viewing video. By breaking up an existing video into separate sections and incorporating text, we cut a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000002712593/germanys-coal-addiction.html" target="_blank">six-minute video</a>&nbsp;down to an experience of about <a href="http://videoslider.knightlab.com/snd-makes/" target="_blank">45 seconds</a>&nbsp;without eliminating content.</p>
<p><strong>So what did I learn from all this?</strong></p>
<p>• A solution isn't a solution if you can't identify the problem it's attempting to solve. That sounds simple enough, right? But when we were brainstorming about possible projects, several ideas came up that were interesting within themselves, but did not have a purpose except to be cool. In starting with a problem, then developing a solution, we were able to better focus our projects and use our time more efficiently.</p>
<p>• Don't be afraid to kill your darlings.&nbsp;Ask the tough questions along the way. By questioning the process of developing a product continuously, we were able to identify challenges to users and ourselves as we went. But we were also able to fine-tune our mission and create a better end product because of what we asked</p>
<p>• The Internet is totally whack, yo. The folks at #SNDmakes only worked to solve four problems of the many we identified, and so many more problems still exist. But that's awesome. That means smart people have the opportunity to continuously improve upon things and raise standards. And with the promise of new devices entering the market all the time, our job of improving the storytelling experience will never end.</p>
<p>So that's that. Be sure you check out the links above to experience and learn more about each project.</p>

    	<h1>We have a winner! Thinking up a first-place graphic.</h1>
    	<p><b>By Adam Baumgartner</b></p><br>
    	<center><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7355/11814614133_fa76e7bd93_o.jpg"></center>
    	<p>My graphic above recently won first place in the infographics category for SND Mizzou's college design content.</p>
    	<p>I was stoked! This is probably my favorite college piece yet.</p>
    	<p>But it's super simple and didn't require much illustration. Why do I like it so much, you may wonder.</p>
    	<p>Well, let me explain.</p>
    	<p>This winter, Muncie became the Arctic as temperature dipped below zero and the windchill even lower.</p>
    	<p>The CDC has a chart that says how long people can be outside before exposed skin becomes at risk of frostbite.</p>
    	<p>Looking at the chart, though, it was unclear exactly what the numbers mean.</p>
    	<p>How can I apply that information to my singular life? What value does the chart have for my peers?</p>
    	<p>Well, lots.</p>
    	<p>But to show that value, I first had to figure out a few standards.</p>
    	<p>Why would most students be outside in the cold? To get to campus.</p>
    	<p>So where on campus is neutral, not specific to a single major? The library. This is also more or less the center of campus.</p>
    	<p>So, I began to do the math. I used Google Maps to approximate walking times and distances.</p>
    	<p>I then checked that with the times detailed on the CDC's chart.</p>
    	<p>Bada-boom, you've got yourself a graphic.</p>
    	<p>I decided to leave every single street in the map, so it's easier for individuals to figure out exactly where their homes are.</p>
    	<p>I think it turned out nicely.</p>
    	<p>If only I could have made an interactive version online ... someday.</p>

    	<p><b>By Adam Baumgartner</b></p><br>
    	<p>I've said it time and time again: My definition of creativity is finding a problem and developing an outside-the-box method of solving it.</p>
    	<p>Recently, my problem was finals.</p>
    	<p>Every semester, I struggle to remember when my final exams take place. The university has a horrible chart for students to reference, but it can get confusing.</p>
    	<P>I knew, too, this has not just been a problem for me. My peers often complain, and my professors say students email them asking when the exams are all the time.</P>
    	<p>So, I decided the Daily News should develop an app.</p>
    	<center><iframe frameborder="0" src="http://unifiedmediadesign.com/finalexams.html" style="width:100%;height:340px;"></iframe></center>
    	<p>My buddy, Aidan Feay made it functional. Smart guy, that Aidan. He just spat out a JavaScript code, input values according to the university's horrible, horrible chart, and BOOM.</p>
    	<p>We have an app.</p>
    	<p>All I did was style it a bit.</p>
    	<p>Every semester, we can update it with the correct information.</p>
    	<p>We'll likely change the inputs to dropdowns, too, to reduce user error.</p>
    	<p>I'm stoked we made this happen. If only so I can use it.</p>
