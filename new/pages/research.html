		<p>Group Nine is an ad-funded company made up of four digital media brands – Thrillist, NowThis News, The Dodo and Seeker. When creating a website for NowThis, it became evident the wireframes we used for our other three sites wouldn’t be sufficient for the brand’s video-only approach.</p>

		<p>We rightly optimized the site for video views, but in doing so made it difficult to place standard banner ads into the site.</p>

		<p>Rather than fitting a square peg in a round hole, I saw the opportunity to create a new ad unit. I recognized it would be important to be capable of running the unit on all four of our sites, essentially creating a single ad unit with a single set of KPIs that ensure advertisers that audiences are seeing their creative.</p>

			My first explorations focused on impact and novelty. I wanted slight motion that wasn’t disruptive to capture audience attention, like a shiny object in the corner of your eye. It’d be impressive, spanning the width of the page and almost the entire height.
		</div>

		<h2>1. Research</h2>

		<p>I began by doing competitive research, looking at solutions from Vox Media, The Outline, Quartz and other organizations with large-format ads. I looked for things like how drastically creative from individual ads varied from each other, for patterns, and for levels of interactivity.</p>

		<p>I also looked into the effectiveness of such ads. Across the board, these companies reported big payoffs from there respective ads.</p>


		<h2>2. Prototype</h2>

		<p>I created a series of designs while exploring solutions, and I quickly put together a prototype as a proof of concept, meant to demonstrate what I was thinking and to excite my product manager.</p>

		<p>The image above is an example of one such prototype.</p>

		<h2>3. Evaluate Existing Resources</h2>

		<p>I knew what I wanted to create, and now I had to figure out how to use my company’s existing tools to execute on it. Developers didn’t have the bandwidth to work on this project, nor would they for future implementations, most likely.</p>

		<p>But we did have a license for a little-used tool that allowed us to create rich ads at preset sizes and serve them across our sites. I opted to explore this tools for a few reasons.</p>

		<p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li class="list-item">The team that would ultimately create a new unit was already familiar with the tool, so training would be minimal.</li>
				<li class="list-item">It was already integrated with our sites, so it would be easy to stand up a test.</li>
				<li class="list-item">It would require no work from developers create or run a new ad.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			None of the presets had the dimensions or functionality I desired, so I read through documentation and figured out a way to gerryrig a small-screen unit to display responsive, full-screen ads.

			I knew I’d need to streamline the process of creating these ads in order for decision-makers to deem this solution viable.
		</div>
		<h2>4. Templatize</h2>

		<p>I’d figured out how to get an ad live, but the tools I used offered a new set of constraints. Beyond that, in the back of my mind was a constant hum reminding me that if we couldn’t produce these large, bespoke ads quickly and with little manpower, these ads would never get off the ground.</p>

		<p>So I went back to my initial prototype and figured out a way to get it to meet the constraints of our ad builder. From that new design, I created another, and another, eventually figuring out patterns and compromises enough to create a template. And from that template, I designed and built a few more ads.</p>

	<div class="content content-3">
		<div class="caption caption-3">
			We designed a test ad, a leaderboard, and a big box to test standard ads against these experimental dimensions.
		</div>
		<h2>4. Test</h2>

		<p>By this point, I had a new unit, I had a way to build it, and I had a template to empower us to build quickly. I also had research to demonstrate these formats perform well. What I didn’t have was data to back up my hypothesis that such an ad would perform well for us.</p>

		<p>So I crafted an experiment.</p>

		<p>I designed a house ad with the large-format template, and my peer designed ads with the same creative in the dimensions of a leaderboard – for desktop – and a big box – for mobile.</p>

		<p>
			We picked a single position on a page, and we performed an A/B test.
