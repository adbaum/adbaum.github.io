                  <p><span>Question:</span>What made you want to become a storyteller?</p>
                  <p><span>Answer:</span>I knew I wanted to be a storyteller since I was your age, because I am from a country named Venezuela in South America. This is country where there is no freedom of expression. That means that people cannot freely share news stories and people like you will not know what is going on in the world. I knew that I didnâ€™t want to live in those conditions. And I knew that I wanted to tell all of the stories that were happening around me. So I became a journalist.</p>
                  <p><span>Question:</span>What advice do you have for aspiring young multimedia storytellers?</p>
                  <p><span>Answer:</span>If you want to be a storyteller, what I would say is that you really have to enjoy reading stories, writing stories and telling them as well. So if you enjoy reading stories to your parents or siblings or writing them for others to read, becoming a professional storyteller may be the job for you!</p>
