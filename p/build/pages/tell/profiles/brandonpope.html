                  <p><span>Question:</span>What made you want to become a journalist?</p>
                  <p><span>Answer:</span>I grew up watching a lot of Ohio TV stations and a lot of documentaries. The most intriguing part about those were the way they would take a person and tell their story in such a creative way – in a way that really captured the viewer.</p>
                  <p>And so it seemed like something you could really have fun with. You get to go to all these cool places, do these cool things. And that’s really what drove me to try it out to see what it was about.</p>
                  <p>Telling stories, digging deeper, getting a behind-the-scenes look – kind of the exclusivity of it too. You get to see things no one else gets to see. … It’s a great field, and a great thing to do. And I’m passionate about it!</p>
                  <p><span>Question:</span>What’s so powerful about telling stories on video?</p>
                  <p><span>Answer:</span>Every medium has its strengths and its weaknesses. However, when you look at video, there’s so much to take out of it. It’s one thing to write that somebody was sad or that someone is heartbroken from something. It’s one thing to hear the anguish and grief from them. But when you can see a person’s face; when you can see the tears and you can see the pain and their reaction to something, that communicates something completely different. And that emotion really transcends the screen.</p> 
                  <p>I think that’s something that video does a really great job of. I think it captures emotion better than any other medium. And I think emotion is what connects people to the story and makes people want to read the story and engage in the content.</p>
