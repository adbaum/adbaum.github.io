                <p>James Robert "Jim" Davis (born July 28, 1945) is an American cartoonist, best known as the creator of the comic strips Garfield and U.S. Acres (aka Orson's Farm), the former of which has been published since 1978 and has since become the world's most widely syndicated comic strip. Davis's other comics work includes Tumbleweeds, Gnorm Gnat and a strip about Mr. Potato Head.</p>
                <p>Davis has written (or in some cases co-written) all of the Emmy Award-winning or nominated Garfield TV specials and was one of the producers behind the Garfield & Friends TV show which aired on CBS from 1988 to 1994. Davis is the writer and executive producer of a trilogy of C.G.-direct-to-video feature films about Garfield, as well as one of the executive producers and the creator for the new CGI-animated TV series The Garfield Show. He continues to work on the strip.</p>

                	<p><span>Question:</span>Garfield began as a comic strip and over the years has evolved into a story told across many platforms, including television, film, books, and more. How has your thinking about the Garfield character changed to accommodate a multimedia approach?</p>
                	<p><span>Answer:</span>My  thinking about the Garfield character has not changed to accommodate the different media; rather I’ve learned more about Garfield’s character thanks engaging him with the different media.</p>
                  <p>In the comic strip, I have to tell a story in 25 words or less. The storylines are relatively simple and straight-forward.</p>
                  <p>In a book, I have more space and time to tell a story than in a comic strip; for TV, I have a half hour, and for a movie, I can take a luxurious hour and a half to tell a story. Garfield is a more complicated character in the longer stories. He has to dig deeper and work harder to support the longer and more challenging story arcs, and that’s a good thing.</p>
                  <p>Next to the comic strip, I would say that animation is my favorite vehicle for creating great humor. In animation, I get more tools to work with like voice, music and sound effects.</p>
                	<p><span>Question:</span>In the early days, how did you come up with ideas for Garfield’s story?</p>
                	<p><span>Answer:</span>I still write for Garfield the same way. It’s like meditation. I focus on Garfield until I can see him in my head and then I present him with a situation like climbing a tree and then I just sit back and watch. When he does something funny, I back up three frames and cut it off. In essence, Garfield writes the material; I just edit.</p>
