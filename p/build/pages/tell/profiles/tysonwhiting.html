                  <p><span>Question:</span>How have comic books affected you as a designer and storyteller?</p>
                  <p><span>Answer:</span>I have a file cabinet behind me right now that has well over 1,000 comic books in it, and that’s not even to mention the many bookshelves that I have and stacks I have lying around. I have a LOT of comic books! And I have read a lot of comic books and collected comic books since high school.</p>

                  <p>What really got me into them was that it’s kind of that bridge between your imagination and a tangible story, like words. And so, your mind is creating the action there, and it’s completely created by the way it’s paneled out or the way color is used. The way you read a comic book is so easy and logical. To me, it’s the perfect medium for absorbing a good story. You just get so much more.</p>

                  <p>I think a big part of it, as far as me as a designer, is that I look at how paneling and how those panels are laid out. Cropping something a certain way can change the entire composition or the entire mood. The way comic books create action is really incredible and beautiful. I think that’s something I like to pull into a lot of illustrations I do to get some kind of movement or make it look like something is popping off the page. </p>

                  <p>There are also illustrations I’m doing where I like to do some more static, basic storytelling. And a lot of that I pull from comic books because you can get exaggerated expressions or have a cartoony feel, and with comic it’s communicated through this bright, vibrant way. …</p>

                  <p>Also, a lot of people think of comic books as just superman or batman, but it’s more than that. Nowadays, there are “indie” comic book creators and they make beautiful stories that are for adults or kids…that aren’t super heroes. They can be biographies or history lessons. There are really incredibly ways that comics are breaking out now and more designers are pulling from that incredible realm.</p>



                  <p><span>Question:</span>What advice do you have for young people who want to become great illustrators?</p>

                  <p><span>Answer:</span>I think the one thing that I would say is learn to draw from real life first. Growing up I drew lots of little cartoons and comics, and I pretty much stuck to that.</p>

                  <p>Once I got into art school…the first thing they did was drop us into a drawing class and they had us drawing from models and still lives from real life. I think that’s really important because when you can translate what you see in real life, your imagination can take it to a completely different level.</p>

                  <p>I love drawing monsters and crazy, colorful, wacky stuff. But I think what makes them stronger is that they are based on realistic perspectives. So if I have a dragon, I want that bone structure or that wave of it’s body to look relatable to realism. Because when someone else looks at something and they can relate to it, even on a fundamental level, that’s where the magic happens. That’s where people really start to enjoy illustrations. Even though it can be crazy or the style can be very different, if you base your cartoons off of realism…then other people can relate to it. </p>

                  <p>Also, just practice all the time. Draw everything you see. Fill up sketchbooks.  And also read a lot. If you’re going to read comic books, read a lot of different things. Try out different books, fiction and nonfiction, read about people, read about magic. The more you practice your drawing in real life and the more you read and look at other artists or other examples, the better you’re going to be. You’re creating a bar for yourself. Hurdling your own bar, bringing your own illustrations to another level…only you can do that.</p>

                  <p>Practice makes perfect! I am sure that everyone has heard that a million times. But that’s the way to get good.</p>
