					<p>Toronto police are investigating a case of homophobia-driven vandalism on Bloor Street West that may be connected to a series of incidents that have taken place in Toronto’s west end over the last several years.</p>
					<p>On Dec 3, InsideToronto reported that Trove, a clothing store in Bloor West Village, had been vandalized repeatedly. Over the summer, vandals had twice used rubber cement and cardboard to cover a Pride sticker displayed in the store’s front window. Carolyn Eby, the co-owner of the Trove chain of stores, tells Xtra that the vandals did it so meticulously, the cardboard covered the sticker perfectly. “Our reaction to that was to make a larger sign,” she says.</p>
					<blockquote>“This is somebody trying to silence us, clearly — which isn’t going to happen.”</blockquote>
					<p>On Nov 29, Eby says, staff arrived at the store to find that someone had sprayed white paint on the store’s back alley wall that said, “be happy, not gay.” Later in the weekend, the Pride sign in the store’s front window was spray painted — but only the part of the sign that had a rainbow flag on it.</p>
					<p>“We are extremely upset and angered by this,” Eby says, adding that she wants to make sure her staff and clients know that Trove is a safe and inclusive place to work.</p>
					<p>Detective Constable Jordan Stowell tells Xtra that police searched the area near Trove for surveillance footage that might assist them in the investigation. InsideToronto reports that Toronto police are looking at Trove’s own surveillance footage. “From that, we are looking at some other occurrences in the area of some other graffiti to see if there is any link or any additional information that we can correlate to the incident that happened on the weekend,” Stowell says.</p>

					<h1>A brief history of BDSM, kink</h1>
					<h2>From Sparta to Weimar Germany, a kink has always been part of sexuality</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p class="byline">By <a href>HG Watson</a>, November 20, 2014</p>
					<div class="feature-body">
					<p>Master Tony leads me down a darkened hallway in his apartment, stopping before a single door. “Would you like to see my playroom?” We enter what was once a bedroom, but that has now been transformed into something very different. A leather sling hangs from the ceiling before a closet filled with various types of leather fetish gear.</p>
					<p>Erotic artwork and posters hang on the charcoal-grey walls, surrounded by shelves lined with dildos and buttplugs of various sizes. In the corner is an antique examining table, and beside it are a series of medical trays, plastic collection containers and metal briefcases containing electro-stimulation equipment.</p>
					<p>Tony, <a href>International LeatherSir 2009</a> and a representative of the Rough House BDSM dungeon parties, has clearly put work into the space. I marvel at the quantity of items in the room, offhandedly describing it as a veritable museum of erotic play.</p>
					<p>“Well, I’ve been collecting for a long time,” he says, proudly.</p>
					<p>A long time, indeed. To explore the roots of BDSM culture is to interrogate the fundamental dynamics of human interaction. Dominance and submission, restraint and role-play have been present in both erotic and non-erotic practices throughout much of recorded history and across different cultures, with examples of it in some of humanity’s earliest texts. Flagellation was regularly performed as part of religious ritual in ancient Sparta, for instance, and evidence of physical aggression in erotic play dates back to the sixth century BCE and is referenced in both Petronius’s Satyricon and the Kama Sutra.</p>

					<h1>Romanticising War</h1>
					<p>And according to professional dominant and BDSM educator Scarlet Riot, consenting to restrictive or controlled experiences has always provided significant emotional relief to people who led otherwise stressful lives and were subject to strict socioeconomic divisions.</p>
					<p>“Giving in to some type of physical anguish has been an important element of many antique and modern faith systems — passion plays, fasting, adolescent rites of passage,” Riot says. “And we’ve [also] seen this in the ways people challenged the stigmas attached to certain sexual practices throughout history.”</p>
					<div class="art">
					<blockquote>“It’s just that instead of resolving those issues with a romantic dinner and roses, they may opt for a spanking and blowjob instead.”</blockquote>
					</div>
					<p>French philosopher the Marquis de Sade, whose 18th-century libertine politics and sexual practices drew the ire of the Catholic Church, wrote extensively of sex acts that often incorporated violence and blasphemy. His “sadistic” works, along with Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s Venus in Furs, heavily influenced much of the power-associated erotic practices that would be referenced in <a href>Victorian literature</a>.</p>
					<p>Scholars trace modern BDSM to a few key sources in the 20th century. The sexual progressiveness of pre–Second World War Weimar Germany was an extension of a European fetish culture that had been in play the first few decades of the 1900s, while a distinctive heterosexual kink culture rose up in the United States during the Depression Era. But it was after the Second World War that things really started to take shape, with the birth of the leather community and the beginnings of a gay subculture.</p>
					<p>“That war was romanticized,” Master Tony says. “And it was romanticized by the people who were actually fighting in the war. Men who had gone overseas had camaraderie and a fraternity, and they loved each other — not in a sexual sense, but in that they looked out for each other.”</p>
					<div class="art-right">

						<blockquote>“Would you like to see my playroom?”</blockquote>
					</div>
					<p>“And a lot of men, when they came back, couldn’t go back to their old lifestyle simply because they enjoyed the hierarchy of things. Some men appreciated having a superior officer or someone who would clean their boots and that kind of thing. Things blossomed from that, and the gay men within the community eventually branched out on their own, founding bike and leather clubs.”</p>
					<p>It was also around this time that the subculture started to enter the mainstream through the work of photographer Irving Klaw, whose damsel-in-distress pin-up photographs featuring model Bettie Page were quite popular.</p>
					<p>“In the Western world, BDSM started making an appearance outside of counterculture in the 1940s, with Page’s erotic photos making the rounds with elements of bondage and restraint,” Riot says. “The reserved sexual attitudes of the time did not inhibit the interests of the kinksters, as is evident by the countless fetish-oriented magazine titles published at the time.”</p>
					<p>“When pin-up girls and posters like that started happening, I think that’s when things changed,” Master Tony says. “People were looking at things more sexually than they had prior to that. Look at the work of Russ Meyer. I mean, the women in his films looked like they were cinched up in corsets, and their breasts were huge and pushed out. And, of course, look at Marlon Brando in The Wild One.”</p>
					<p>Meanwhile, underground leather culture thrived in many major cities where gay communities had sprung up after the war, including New York and San Francisco. Mr Leather and Mr Drummer contests were established early on, and magazines like Physique Pictorial popularized images of the male form that were overtly homoerotic.</p>
					<p>“It ran under the radar of pornography because it had men posing in thongs, but they were doing things that were incredibly masculine,” Master Tony says. “There was wrestling. There was roughhousing. Guys on bikes, that kind of thing.”</p>
					<div class="art-left">
						<blockquote>“There was wrestling. There was roughhousing.”</blockquote>
					</div>
					<p>The magazine also ran artwork by Tom of Finland. The artist had served during the Second World War, and his time fighting alongside German soldiers in Russia inspired much of his artwork, which fetishized men in uniform.</p>
					<p>“A lot of Tom of Finland’s stuff has actual Nazi photographs that he’s touched up to be sexualized,” <a href>Master Tony</a> says. “So their cock would be hanging out, that kind of thing. And romanticizing the britches, the boots, the uniform and that hyper-masculine image. There’s something more exhilarating about that than seeing people cuddling in bed.”</p>
