					<p>Toronto police are investigating a case of homophobia-driven vandalism on Bloor Street West that may be connected to a series of incidents that have taken place in Toronto’s west end over the last several years.</p>
					<p>On Dec 3, InsideToronto reported that Trove, a clothing store in Bloor West Village, had been vandalized repeatedly. Over the summer, vandals had twice used rubber cement and cardboard to cover a Pride sticker displayed in the store’s front window. Carolyn Eby, the co-owner of the Trove chain of stores, tells Xtra that the vandals did it so meticulously, the cardboard covered the sticker perfectly. “Our reaction to that was to make a larger sign,” she says.</p>
					<blockquote>“This is somebody trying to silence us, clearly — which isn’t going to happen.”</blockquote>
					<p>On Nov 29, Eby says, staff arrived at the store to find that someone had sprayed white paint on the store’s back alley wall that said, “be happy, not gay.” Later in the weekend, the Pride sign in the store’s front window was spray painted — but only the part of the sign that had a rainbow flag on it.</p>
					<p>“We are extremely upset and angered by this,” Eby says, adding that she wants to make sure her staff and clients know that Trove is a safe and inclusive place to work.</p>
					<p>Detective Constable Jordan Stowell tells Xtra that police searched the area near Trove for surveillance footage that might assist them in the investigation. InsideToronto reports that Toronto police are looking at Trove’s own surveillance footage. “From that, we are looking at some other occurrences in the area of some other graffiti to see if there is any link or any additional information that we can correlate to the incident that happened on the weekend,” Stowell says.</p>
