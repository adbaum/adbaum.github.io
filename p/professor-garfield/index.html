                <h2>What is Multimedia Storytelling?</h2>
                <p>Storytelling has been around as long as people have been on Earth. Around the world, stories have been shared in every culture to entertain, to educate, to explain values and morals, and to record history.</p>
                <p>Before there were words, ancient humans drew pictures on cave walls as a way to communicate. The earliest cave paintings date back 40,000 years and were found inside caves in Spain.</p>
                <p>When formal languages began to emerge, people told stories orally around campfires and in makeshift theaters. And when written communication was formed, storytelling became an act of writing. People copied stories by hand and shared them with one another.</p>
                <p>But it wasn’t until Johannes Guttenberg invented the printing press in 1439 that storytelling got it’s most significant boost. Now, stories could be reproduced more quickly and in larger quantities, giving people greater access to information.</p>
                <p>Storytelling has continued to evolve with new inventions like the radio, television and computers. And now, we have many different ways to tell and share stories, from audio and video, to photographs and information graphics. And the introduction of the Internet in the 1990s once again made telling and sharing digital story forms like these much easier for people.</p>
                <p>Put simply, multimedia storytelling combines several story forms – such as words, video, audio, photos and graphics – to tell a single story. And the best multimedia stories explore how different parts of a story are best told, regardless of format.</p>

              <h2>What kind of stories can be told with multimedia?</h2>
                <p class="cheat-lol">Multimedia stories can be fun, interesting, and engaging. But it’s important to know that not all stories make good multimedia stories. Only stories that have the potential to be told using different story forms, such as video, audio, photos, illustrations, or information graphics – in addition to words – make for good multimedia stories.</p>
                <p>The best multimedia stories have diverse characteristics. For example, they include action for video, a process that can be illustrated with an information graphic, opportunities for audio that helps enhance the story, and/or photos that capture dramatic moments in time. Of course, not EVERY story will have EVERY story form. But, you can often enrich a story by adding one or two multimedia pieces to it.</p>
                <p>For example, imagine you’re telling a story about ancient dinosaurs. Wouldn’t it be cool if you could let your readers LISTEN to what they sounded like? Or imagine you’re telling a story about a great boat race. Wouldn’t it be awesome if your readers could explore the boat in the story through an interactive graphic? These are the kinds of features that bring a story to life!</p>
