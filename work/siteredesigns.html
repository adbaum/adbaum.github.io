	        	<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.racked.com/">Racked.com</a> is one of the sites Vox Media acquired in 2013. In 2015, it relaunched with new branding, new design, and a new editorial vision.</p>
                <p>I worked on much of the initial design exploration, putting together a competitive analysis, font boards, and mood boards. I also worked on some of the comps prior to development.</p>
                <p>These are some of my mood boards. Each has a name to describe the tones – part of a strategy intended to make design languages clearer to stakeholders.</p>

                <h5>A Light Jacket</h5>
                <img src="assets/racked-mb1.jpg" alt="Racked moodboard">
                <p></p>
                <p>Parts of these boards went into final design direction, such as the tilt established in the first.</p>
                <p>I worked under the direction of people such as Georgia Cowley and Jason Santa Maria, who taught me how to research and develop design languages, as well as how to design for systems.</p>
                <h2 class="reverse orange">Daily Xtra</h2>
                <p>I also acted as a designer for an LGBTQ news site in Canada called <a href="http://www.dailyxtra.com/">Daily Xtra</a>. The organization has newsrooms in Toronto, Ottawa and Canada. They had previously had a biweekly print product before switching to a digital model in 2014.</p>
                <p>I worked with a user experience consultant's wireframes to create the design language of the site, which will spread to future iterations, including a move to a responsive design.</p>

                <p></p>
                <p>For this editorial team, I did a competitive analysis, created type boards and mood boards, designed comps, and <a href="http://afbaumgartner.com/p/dx-styleguide/new/">wrote some CSS</a> to help clarify some of the documentation I provided developers.
